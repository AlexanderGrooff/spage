Make sure that the behaviour of the executors (like local/temporal) are tightly aligned. They are started with ExecuteGraph, and should make sure that the given graph is executed with all relevant provided configs, like sequential/parallel.

The methods on the GraphExecutor interface are there to make sure that the different executors are relatively similar. However, when necessary feel free to edit where necessary.

Make sure that TemporalGraphExecutor and LocalGraphExecutor keep in line with the GraphExecutor interface.
