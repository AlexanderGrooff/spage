The Jinja templating engine is provided by jinja-go, which is provided at github.com/AlexanderGrooff/jinja-go. It's a faster version of Jinja/Pongo2, and provides two critical functions:
- jinja.TemplateString, which can be used to render strings like `Some string with a {{ variable }}`.
- jinja.EvaluateExpression, which can be used to render a single variable like `item.name`. Useful in places like `when` on an Ansible task.

Jinja-go is a library maintained by myself, so whenever the library misbehaves we can change whatever we deem necessary.
