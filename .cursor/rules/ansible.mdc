By default, Spage will generate a program that is functionally identical to Ansible. However, Spage also allows for more complex behavior, such as conditional tasks, multiple hosts, and more.
Spage acts as a drop-in replacement for Ansible, so any playbook that can be run with Ansible can also be run with Spage. There are extra features that Spage offers:

- Revert functionality: Spage will automatically revert any changes made by a task if the task fails. You can specify a revert task for each task in the playbook.
- Parallel execution: Spage will automatically parallelize tasks across all hosts, and you can control the flow with `before`/`after`.
- No Python dependency: Spage is a single binary that can be run on any system.
