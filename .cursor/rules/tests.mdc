Tests are done in a large bash script [test.sh](mdc:test.sh) that runs many kinds of playbooks. All modules should be tested in their own playbook to thoroughly check all kinds of behaviour described in the module.

When writing testcases, think of the following:
- Does it work on both local and remote hosts?
- Does reverting work?
- Are all fields registered correctly?
- *EVERY* field should be able to be templated! Strings like "{{ somevariable }}" should always work, and should correctly determine the order of execution.
